   69  #How did we do that, we did it with the * wildcard. It is used to match zero or more characters in a file name or a path. It allows us to search for a pattern for any filename that just ends with .py. You can also specify certain characters as well if you are searching for certain filenames. For example, ? wildcard matches any single character. For example, ls a?b.txt would match any file with a name that has a “b” surrounded by an “a” and any single character, such as “a1b.txt” or “aXb.txt”.

   75  #If it is very large file with 1000s of lines you can use head to see the first 10 lines, and tail to see the last 10 lines of a file.
   76  #We can also redirect content to a file using the append ">>" operater. This is useful for logging information:
   77  echo "2024-02-01,80" >> logfile.txt
   78  ls
   79  echo "2024-02-01,80" >> logfile.txt
   80  #Now what happens if you want to edit a file itself. We can use a built in terminal editor called Nano to do that.
   81  nano notes2.txt
   82  #find and search
   83  find -name "day*"
   84  find -name "patient*"
   85  #Now there may be cases where you want to search for specific words in files, and you can use "grep" for that. For example if we want to find all rows that have the word "virginica" in it we can do it as follows:
   86  grep -n "virginica" *.csv
